In this scenario you will learn how to add a Healthcheck that will check if a service within the cluster is available to receive traffic or not. With a healthcheck enabled, if a service crashes then Envoy will stop sending traffic.

You will learn how to:

* Add a HTTP Health check 

* Test load balancing options when a service is unavailable

* Ensure how to continue to deliver successful requests when services are unavailable
