[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud native applications.

The scenario aims to demonstrate how to configure Envoy as a proxy, allowing you to forward traffic to different destinations.

In this scenario you will learn how to:

* Configure Envoy Proxy to forward traffic to external websites

* Configure Envoy Proxy to forward traffic to Docker Containers

* Path based routing for controlling traffic destination

Once the Envoy proxy is in place, it can be extended to support load balancing, health checking and metrics that are discussed in more advanced scenarios.
