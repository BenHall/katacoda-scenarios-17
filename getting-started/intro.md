[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.

The following scenario demonstrates how to configure Envoy as a proxy, allowing you to forward traffic to different destinations.

You will learn how to:

- Configure Envoy Proxy to forward traffic to external websites.

- Configure Envoy Proxy to forward traffic to Docker Containers.

- Perform path-based routing for controlling traffic destination.

Once the Envoy proxy is in place, it can be extended to support load balancing, health checking and metrics. These are discussed in more advanced scenarios.
